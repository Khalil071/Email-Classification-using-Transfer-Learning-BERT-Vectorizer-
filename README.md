Email Classification using Transfer Learning (BERT + Vectorizer)
This project classifies emails into predefined categories using transfer learning with the BERT model for text embedding and a vectorizer for additional feature extraction. The aim is to leverage the power of BERT for language understanding and improve the email classification task accuracy.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset consists of labeled emails categorized into different classes (e.g., spam, promotions, personal, etc.).
Model: The project combines BERT for transfer learning-based text embedding and a vectorizer (such as TF-IDF) to represent the text data before classification.
Purpose: The goal is to classify emails into categories efficiently using a combination of BERT embeddings and vectorized features.

Dataset
The dataset should consist of emails with the following structure:

email: The text content of the email.
label: The corresponding category label (e.g., spam, personal, promotions, etc.).
Approach: Using Transfer Learning with BERT and Vectorizer
BERT for Embedding: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is used for generating embeddings from the email text. BERT captures the contextual meaning of words, making it highly suitable for understanding and classifying email content.
Vectorizer for Features: Along with BERT embeddings, a vectorizer (e.g., TF-IDF) is applied to extract additional features like term frequency for better performance.
Model: The BERT model generates embeddings, and the vectorizer helps in transforming the text data into a suitable format for classification. A classifier (like a Dense neural network or Logistic Regression) is trained on these features.

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('emails.csv')  # assuming emails.csv with 'email' and 'label' columns
X = data['email']
y = data['label']

# Split the dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Tokenize text data using BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
train_encodings = tokenizer(list(X_train), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
val_encodings = tokenizer(list(X_val), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

# BERT model for transfer learning
bert_model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Extract embeddings from BERT
input_ids = Input(shape=(512,), dtype=np.int32)
attention_mask = Input(shape=(512,), dtype=np.int32)

bert_output = bert_model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
x = bert_output.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]  # Use the [CLS] token output for classification

# Add a Dense layer for classification
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.3)(x)
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

# Compile the model
model = Model(inputs=[input_ids, attention_mask], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(
    [np.array(train_encodings['input_ids']), np.array(train_encodings['attention_mask'])],
    np.array(y_train),
    validation_data=(
        [np.array(val_encodings['input_ids']), np.array(val_encodings['attention_mask'])],
        np.array(y_val)
    ),
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=8
)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict([np.array(val_encodings['input_ids']), np.array(val_encodings['attention_mask'])])
predicted_labels = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, predicted_labels)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
Results
After training the model, evaluate it using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You can visualize the training process and performance with graphs of training and validation loss/accuracy.
